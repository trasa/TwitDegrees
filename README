TWIT-DEGREES

A distributed Crawler/Controller architecture for crawling Twitter, gathering 
data on followers and friends, and then providing visualizations of that 
data for analysis. Written in C# using MSMQ to manage communication between 
crawlers and controllers. High volume, high bandwidth, gathered 100s of 
millions of records in a very short amount of time.

This was put together as an experiment to see if it would generate more
business from a client of an employer of mine.  It didn't, so the project
was canceled and nothing further came from it.  

If I were to do this again now, I'd do things differently, particularly
in how the data itself was actually stored -- this outstripped capacity
very quickly, and this was written a while back when Twitter was still
(kinda) new.
